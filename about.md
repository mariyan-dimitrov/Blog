My name is Mariyan Dimitrov, Software developer at DevriX with JavaScript. I also know little bit of C#, Java and C/C++. Iâ€™m a student in two universities: University of National and World Economy with Applied informatics and in Software University.

I love to keep myself busy and to work under pressure. In my free time, I play an electric guitar, read some geeky articles on the internet. Sometimes when I have free time (which is barely happening these days) I read some books and listen to some music.
